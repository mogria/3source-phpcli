# 3source-phpcli

This docker image runs the php-cli inside the `/data` volume.

This is also the base image for some of my docker images:

    * [docker-laravel-artisan](https://github.com/mogria/3source-artisan)

This image is heavily inspired from [dylanlindgren/docker-laravel-phpcli](https://github.com/dylanlindgren/docker-laravel-phpcli).

This image is used to develop the [3source](https://github.com/mogria/3source) project.
