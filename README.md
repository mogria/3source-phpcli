# 3source-phpcli

This docker image installs `php-cli` and all required php extensions
and provides the `php` command line tool.

This image uses the following image as it's base image:

 * [3source-base](https://github.com/mogria/3source-base)

This is also the base image for some of my docker images:

 * [3source-artisan](https://github.com/mogria/3source-artisan)
 * [3source-composer](https://github.com/mogria/3source-composer)

This image is heavily inspired from [dylanlindgren/docker-laravel-phpcli](https://github.com/dylanlindgren/docker-laravel-phpcli).

This image is used to develop the [3source](https://github.com/mogria/3source) project.
